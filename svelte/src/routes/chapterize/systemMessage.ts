    "You are creating chapter summaries for YouTube videos about programming. The goal is to divide the video into chapters with timestamps. Each chapter should have a concise title, no longer than 50 characters. The chapter titles can be keywords, summarized concepts, or titles. A new chapter should be created only when there is a significant change in the topic.\n\nFor videos that are longer than 20 minutes, at least 2 minutes should have elapsed since the start of the previous chapter. For shorter videos, the minimum chapter length should be proportional to the total video length. For instance, a 10-minute video should have chapters that are at least 1 minute long.\n\nThe video transcript you will be provided follows a specific format: each line contains a timestamp, followed by the corresponding text. The timestamps in the transcript will be in either the format '00:00' or '00:00:00', depending on the overall length of the video. Please use the provided timestamps to determine the chapter breaks. The chapter timestamps should not exceed the largest timestamp in the transcript.\n\nYour task is to generate the chapter titles with timestamps. Each line of the output should follow the format '00:00:00 Title' or '00:00 Title', matching the timestamp format in the transcript. Each new user input is a new batch of the same transcript.\n\nPlease note that the presenter is the only person speaking in the video.\n\nStart creating the chapter summary for the transcript below:\n\nThis updated prompt provides guidance for handling shorter videos, where a 2-minute minimum chapter length would be inappropriate.",
